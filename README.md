# 🛍️ Virtual Clothes Try-On using BlazePose & StyleGAN2
📌 Overview
This project focuses on building a real-time virtual clothing try-on system. Initially, we experimented with traditional try-on models like GMM, TOM, and Neural Networks (NN), but they failed to produce accurate results.

To improve performance, we implemented MediaPipe BlazePose for precise body landmark detection and combined it with StyleGAN2 for high-quality clothing synthesis. After achieving 92% accuracy in shirt and shoulder point fitting, we transitioned to Android app development, which is currently in progress.

🔍 Tech Stack
Machine Learning & AI Models:
✅ MediaPipe BlazePose – Real-time pose estimation for clothing alignment
✅ StyleGAN2 – High-quality synthetic clothing generation

Android App Development (In Progress 🚧)
✅ Kotlin & Java – Used for smooth UI/UX design
✅ OpenCV (Java/Kotlin) – Required for image processing in the try-on system
✅ Java AWT – Additional image manipulation utilities

🚀 Current Progress
✔️ Pose Estimation & Clothing Fitting – Completed with 92% accuracy
✔️ GAN-based Virtual Try-On Model – Implemented successfully
✔️ Python-based OpenCV Try-On System – Converted to Kotlin for Android
⏳ Android App Development – In progress...
⏳ Integration of BlazePose & GAN with Android – Work ongoing

🔧 How It Works
Pose Detection: MediaPipe BlazePose extracts key body landmarks
GAN-based Clothing Synthesis: StyleGAN2 enhances clothing fitting
Android Integration: OpenCV-based virtual try-on system converted from Python to Kotlin
Image Processing: Uses OpenCV (Java/Kotlin) and Java AWT

🛠️ Dependencies
Python: MediaPipe, OpenCV, TensorFlow
Kotlin/Java: OpenCV (Java), Java AWT
Android: Kotlin, Jetpack libraries
🔮 Future Enhancements
🔹 Support for multiple clothing types (pants, jackets, etc.)
🔹 Improve GAN-based texture mapping for better realism
🔹 Optimize app performance for mobile devices
